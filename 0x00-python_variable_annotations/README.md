# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

![Python Variable Annotations](https://i.redd.it/y9y25tefi5401.png)

## Description
This project focuses on advanced Python concepts, specifically around **type annotations**. Type annotations in Python help specify the data types of variables, function arguments, and return values, leading to more readable and maintainable code. Additionally, using tools like `mypy`, developers can statically check the type correctness of their Python code.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand and apply type annotations in Python 3.
- Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
- Explain and implement duck typing in Python.
- Validate Python code with `mypy`.

## Resources
To complete this project, it is recommended that you read or watch the following resources:
- [Python 3 Typing Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy Cheat Sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Project Files
- **Python files:** All Python files should use type annotations where applicable and should be validated with `mypy` for type correctness.
- **README.md:** A description of the project, objectives, and necessary tools.
- **Other Requirements:**
  - Each Python file should end with a new line.
  - You should use Python 3.8 or later for type annotation compatibility.
  - Code will be verified with `mypy` and other linters if required.

## Requirements
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or later
- **Editor:** You may use editors such as `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, or Visual Studio Code.
- **Type Checker:** Install `mypy` to validate type annotations:
  ```bash
  pip install mypy
