## Introduction

This project covers the fundamentals of **Unit Testing** and **Integration Testing** in Python. Unit and integration tests are essential to ensure that individual components of code work correctly on their own and also function seamlessly together. Using these testing methodologies helps maintain code reliability and efficiency, making them indispensable in software development.

Python’s `unittest` framework will be used for creating tests, along with `unittest.mock` for mocking dependencies, enabling isolated testing of specific functions. By the end of this project, you’ll understand how to implement unit tests and integration tests effectively, including testing patterns like mocking, parameterization, and using fixtures.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Differentiate between unit tests and integration tests.
2. Understand the purpose of common testing patterns, including mocking, parameterization, and fixtures.
3. Use the `unittest` framework in Python to create and run tests.
4. Mock dependencies to isolate code functionality during testing.
5. Implement parameterized tests to cover a range of inputs and scenarios.

## Concepts

### Unit Tests

**Unit Testing** is the process of testing individual functions or methods to verify that they produce the expected outputs given certain inputs. Each unit test typically checks:
- Standard inputs
- Edge or corner cases
- Any specific exceptions or error handling

Unit tests should focus on the logic defined within the function itself, without depending on external resources or complex interactions. When external functions are necessary, they are typically **mocked** to isolate the unit being tested.

**Example Scenario:** Testing a function that adds two numbers. You’d ensure it returns the correct sum for various cases, like positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.

### Integration Tests

**Integration Testing** examines how different parts of a codebase work together. Integration tests are broader and involve multiple components interacting to perform a task end-to-end, often without mocking. Low-level functions, such as those that perform external calls (e.g., HTTP requests, database access), may still be mocked, but the focus is on testing realistic interactions across components.

**Example Scenario:** Testing a process that retrieves data from an API, processes it, and stores it in a database.

### Mocking

**Mocking** is the process of creating "fake" components to simulate the behavior of real ones during testing. This technique is used to:
- Isolate the code being tested from external dependencies
- Control the environment and behavior of dependencies
- Speed up testing by avoiding slow external calls (like network requests)

Python’s `unittest.mock` library allows you to replace parts of your code with mock objects, setting return values and inspecting how they are used.

### Parameterized Testing

**Parameterized Testing** allows you to run the same test logic with multiple sets of input values, covering a range of cases more efficiently. The `parameterized` library in Python simplifies this process, letting you define a single test function that can accept various inputs.

### Fixtures

**Fixtures** are a way to set up preconditions or state before running tests, ensuring that each test runs in a consistent environment. Fixtures are especially useful in integration testing, where tests might rely on specific resources, like a database or configuration.

## Running Tests

To execute your tests, use the following command:

```bash
$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
